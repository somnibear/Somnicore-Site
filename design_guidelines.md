# Somnicore Website Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Selected Framework:** Apple Human Interface Guidelines with wellness-focused customization

**Rationale:** As you're applying for Apple developer accounts and building a sleep wellness product, adopting Apple's design principles establishes immediate credibility while allowing for calming, health-focused adaptations. The clean, content-first approach emphasizes trust and professionalism essential for developer account approval.

**Core Principles:**
- Clarity over cleverness - information must be immediately accessible
- Professional credibility - every element reinforces legitimacy
- Calm sophistication - visual design reflects sleep wellness without being overtly "sleepy"
- Trust-building through transparency
